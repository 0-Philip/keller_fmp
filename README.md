# About
This repository contains and documents the software components of my master graduation prodject, _Active Interfaces in the Office_, 
at the department of Industrial Design at Eindhoven University of Technology.

## About the project
Office work often involves unhealthy amounts of sitting. Most computer interfaces perpetuate this behaviour. 
This project investigates the impact of physically active interfaces in the office environment. 
A prototype capable of long-term situated use elicits opportunities and obstacles, while lower fidelity 
proofs of concept explore the emergent qualities of a potential ecosystem of physically active interfaces.

With MailMarch, you need to post an envelope to send an email; LaunchLocker turns loading time into active time as you take software out of storage; 
PowerPress replaces remembering hotkeys with reaching for a button.
